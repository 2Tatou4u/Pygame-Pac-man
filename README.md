# pac-man made in pygame
Hello ! I don't know if anybody will read this but here we are. \
I made a recreation of pac-man with python and pygame library, this was a school project but I push the concept a little to much and here we are.. You can use my code and edit it, I don't really care (I mean pac-man is not my game so I can't claim this is mine..) \
This is my first github publication so I hope I don't messed up somewhere. \
# how far does the game go ?
I have a massed up organisation but here all the thing I made by far : \
- Translate text file to maze
- An autotile function
- Groupsprite for each type of texture (wall, bonus, dot)
- Little animation (gum blink ect..)
- Smouth player control (I hope you understande what I'm thinking by "smouth")
- Basic IA for each ghost (Not balanced)
- Add data for hi-score
- Add a leaderboard menu
- Try to make a menu
- Add 5 different maze
- And plenty of other thing that don't really matters
