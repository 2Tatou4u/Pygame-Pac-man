# pac-man made in pygame
Hello ! I don't know if anybody will read this but here we are. \
I made a recreation of pac-man with python and pygame library, this was a school project but I push the concept a little to much and here we are.. You can use my code and edit it, I don't really care (I mean pac-man is not my game so I can't claim this is mine..) \
This is my first github publication so I hope I don't messed up somewhere. \
